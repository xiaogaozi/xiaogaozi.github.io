# About

I'm **xiaogaozi**. I work at [Juicedata](https://juicefs.com), former [Xiaohongshu](https://www.xiaohongshu.com), [Jike](https://www.ruguoapp.com), [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com) and [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com) employee. I'm a backend engineer, geek, blogger, guitar player, hobbyist photographer, traveler, 3A (sometimes indie) gamer, automator and full-time dreamer. Not necessarily in that order.

I maintain a (maybe) weekly digest called "Maybe News", if you have interest you could subscribe to it [here](https://maybe.news).

You could find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/xiaogaozi), [X](https://x.com/xiaogaozi), [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/xiaogaozi), [Douban](https://www.douban.com/people/xiaogaozi), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaochangjian) and many more places.
